## Overview
This project contains implementations of various algorithms, focusing on the sliding window technique and other algorithmic strategies. The goal is to provide clear and efficient solutions to common problems encountered in programming and computer science.

## Sliding Window Algorithm
The sliding window algorithm is a powerful technique used to solve problems involving arrays or strings. It is particularly useful for problems that require finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions. 

For detailed implementation, refer to the [sliding_window.go](src/sliding_window.py) file.

## Other Algorithms
This section includes various algorithmic techniques and their respective functions. For more information, check the [other_algorithms.go](src/other_algorithms.go) file.

## Usage
To use the algorithms in this project, clone the repository and navigate to the `src` directory. You can run the Go files directly or import them into your own Go projects.

## Contributing
Contributions are not welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional algorithms, please feel free to submit a pull request, but I won't approve it!
